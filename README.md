# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts

Hacker News is a extremely popular site in the tech and startup world. A user can submit a post, where they are voted on commented on, very similar to reddit. The top posts can recieve hundreds of thousands of visitors.

I am aiming to explore two types of posts: Ask HN and Show HN.

To find out the following:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?

Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
